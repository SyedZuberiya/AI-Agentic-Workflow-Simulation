# ðŸ¤– Agentic Market Research Report Generator

This project simulates an **AI Agent Workflow** to generate structured market research reports in Markdown format.

### ðŸ§  How It Works

This system simulates 3 agents working together:

- **Agent 1: Content Fetcher**  
  Simulates gathering market data on a user-specified topic.

- **Agent 2: Summarizer**  
  Uses HuggingFace Transformers (BART model) to generate an executive summary.

- **Agent 3: Report Compiler**  
  Compiles both the summary and detailed content into a Markdown `.md` file.

### ðŸ“Œ Features

- Automated report generation for any topic  
- Executive summary using BART (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)  
- Structured Markdown output for easy export  
- Modular agent-based simulation  
- Ready to be extended with real APIs or tools like LangChain agents, web scraping, etc.
